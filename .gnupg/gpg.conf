# Some commented settings from GPGTools that looked useful are follwing.

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
# certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.
# This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.

# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
#
# Example HKP keyservers:
#      hkp://keys.gnupg.net
#
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
#
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
#
# If you have problems connecting to a HKP server through a buggy http
# proxy, you can use keyserver option broken-http-proxy (see below),
# but first you should make sure that you have read the man page
# regarding proxies (keyserver option honor-http-proxy)
#
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred keyserver.
# Note that most servers (with the notable exception of
# ldap://keyserver.pgp.com) synchronize changes with each other.  Note
# also that a single server name may actually point to multiple
# servers via DNS round-robin.  hkp://keys.gnupg.net is an example of
# such a "server", which spreads the load over a number of physical
# servers.  To see the IP address of the server actually used, you may use
# the "--keyserver-options debug".

# Common options for keyserver functions:
#
# include-disabled = when searching, include keys marked as "disabled"
#                    on the keyserver (not all keyservers support this).
#
# no-include-revoked = when searching, do not include keys marked as
#                      "revoked" on the keyserver.
#
# verbose = show more information as the keys are fetched.
#           Can be used more than once to increase the amount
#           of information shown.
#
# use-temp-files = use temporary files instead of a pipe to talk to the
#                  keyserver.  Some platforms (Win32 for one) always
#                  have this on.
#
# keep-temp-files = do not delete temporary files after using them
#                   (really only useful for debugging)
#
# honor-http-proxy = if the keyserver uses HTTP, honor the http_proxy
#                    environment variable
#
# broken-http-proxy = try to work around a buggy HTTP proxy
#
# auto-key-retrieve = automatically fetch keys as needed from the keyserver
#                     when verifying signatures or when importing keys that
#                     have been revoked by a revocation key that is not
#                     present on the keyring.
#
# no-include-attributes = do not include attribute IDs (aka "photo IDs")
#                         when sending keys to the keyserver.

keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve

#  *** Options for GPGTools ***

# Automatic key location
#
# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using the
# auto-key-locate option.  This happens when encrypting to an email
# address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no
# user@example.com keys on the local keyring.  This option takes the
# following arguments, in the order they are to be tried:
#
# cert = locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.
#        GnuPG can handle both the PGP (key) and IPGP (URL + fingerprint)
#        CERT methods.
#
# pka = locate a key using DNS PKA.
#
# ldap = locate a key using the PGP Universal method of checking
#        "ldap://keys.(thedomain)".  For example, encrypting to
#        user@example.com will check ldap://keys.example.com.
#
# keyserver = locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using
#             the keyserver option.
#
# You may also list arbitrary keyservers here by URL.
#
# Try CERT, then PKA, then LDAP, then hkp://keys.gnupg.net:
